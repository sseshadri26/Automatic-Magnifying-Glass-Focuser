# Automatic-Magnifying-Glass-Focuser
A low-key joke project for a hardware hackthon. There's some 3D models here, some code, etc. All to let a magnfying glass automatically focus the sun's light to create fire. In its current state it works quite poorly.

I was going in to this hackathon with bigger plans. But all 4 of my teammates dropped out last minute :(
So I made a joke that I had been wanting to make for a while :)
